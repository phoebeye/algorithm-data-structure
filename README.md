# algorithm-data-structure

Every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis. I created this repo for implementing algorithm/data-structure from scratch on my own. I believe this exercise would help me improve analytical skills and build efficient and scalable applications.

Welcome any feedbacks on my implementations.
